# Data Science Project for HARP Internship

*All the visualizations have been put under the Visualizations folder. There is a video presentation that is linked [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=886463801942380&ref=watch_permalink) and
a Powerpoint presentation that can be accessed online [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAElxSxkp6U/qyyu0i38NPY5s0wh0QVznA/view?utm_content=DAElxSxkp6U&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).
If you want to read more about the process of the project, I have detailed it in my portfolio website [here](https://minhanh2806.github.io/portfolio/harp-internship/).*

## Overview

This summer, I intern at Harassment and Reporting Platform, a non-profit organization with a goal to increase awareness 
on assault and harassment. We aim to gather crow-sourced contextual data, analyze, and create a cohesive narrative
to bridge the gap of technical research and public understanding. While at the data team, I can explore and 
propose a data science project to research a topic related to harassment and assault of personal interest.

## Goals

The main aim of the project is to gain insights to social media representation associated with 
the Asian American hate crimes incidents. 

## Methods

For our purposes, we choose the New York Times journal because it is reputable and it has a clear API documentation.
* Request article data from New York Times using the NYT API
* Parse the data into the format that we want, save into a csv file. 
  * The Asians American NYT Dataset.csv file is all the headlines for
the tag while the updated csv file is only within the pandemic timeframe.

* Download the US statistics on Covid cases from the [New York Time repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

* Explore the NYT dataset
  
* Merge two dataset
  
* Create wordclouds for all the headlines and the headlines in the pandemic.
* Create heatmap visualizations
* Create cases percentage versus each subject counts visualizations
* Create subject counts visualization
