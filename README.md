# Data Science Project for HARP

## Overview

This summer, I intern at Harassment and Reporting Platform, a non-profit organization with a goal to increase awareness 
on assault and harassment. We aim to gather crow-sourced contextual data, analyze, and create a cohesive narrative
to bridge the gap of technical research and public understanding. While at the data team, I can explore and 
propose a data science project to research a topic related to harassment and assault of personal interest.

## Goals

The main aim of the project is to gain insights to social media representation regarding the sentiment associated with 
the Asian American hate crimes incidents.
